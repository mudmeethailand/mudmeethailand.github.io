        	<h3>WHAT EXACTLY IS MUDMEE?</h3> <br>
            <p>Mudmee is a unique way of hand weaving fabric on old wooden looms. Mudmee is an ancient type of woven cloth produced in areas of Isan in the northeastern region of Thailand. Mudmee weaving is known as ikat weaving throughout the world, but in Thailand, the technique is referred to as mudmee weaving. Mudmee is a weaving pattern used to create hand woven fabric with a pattern or design. Mudmee weaving creates a pattern with only one thread. The exact areas of a thread that are to be dyed a certain colour, are controlled by a tie-dying method. Mudmee is produced through the traditional method of tying in the desired pattern with straw, hay or banana ropes. These ties prevent the dye from affecting the thread underneath them, a bit like simply tie-dying does.</p>

                	<p>The mudmee motifs are based on the varieties of patterns and lines. There are three motif variations: weft mudmee, warp mudmee and double mudmee. Mudmee is a weaving method used to create a hand- woven fabric with a pattern or design. Mudmee patterns are also contemporary and always evolving. Mudmee fabric can be either silk or cotton. Mudmee is now being used in exciting new ways as well, such as in drapery, upholstery and fashion. Mudmee is produced through the traditional method of tying in the desired pattern with straw, hay or banana ropes. Mudmee weaving creates a fabric pattern in a whole different way. Mudmee weaving creates a pattern with only a single thread Mudmee weaving creates a fabric pattern in a wholly different way. Mudmee weaving creates a pattern with only a single thread Mudmee yarn prior to weaving is repeatedly dyed different colors, depending on how many colors are desired for the pattern. The exact areas of a thread that are to be dyed a certain color, are controlled by a tie-dying method. These ties prevent the dye from affecting the thread underneath them, just like simply tie-dying does. By this method, a skilled mudmee artisan (often not the weaver) can create dyed patterns for a single weft thread (horizontal thread). The pattern is then revealed as the vertical and horizontal threads (the weft warp) are woven together. The word “mudmee” is often translated to mean “tie-dyed” or “tied threads” and its origin comes from Isaan, which is Northeast Thailand. Isaan is where mudmee weaving was first developed and practiced in Thailand and where today, you’ll find the finest mudmee fabrics. You can purchase mudmee fabric anywhere in Thailand, but be assured, if it’s authentic mudmee, it was produced and woven in Isaan.. Ancient mudmee fabrics used natural dyes to create their colorful patterns. You can still purchase mudmee that uses natural dyes, although these fabrics are far more expensive than ones that use commercial dyes. The problem with natural dyes is that you can’t wash or clean the mudmee without severely washing away the color, and therefore ruining your exquisite fabric.</p>

            <p>Mudmee or ikat is hand woven Thai silk or cotton fabric that comes from Isaan, Thailand's Northeastern region that is made up of 17 provinces on the Khorat plateau.  Located about 400km from Bangkok and 55km south of downtown Khon Kaen, Chonnabot is renowned for mudmee silk made using a technique in which warped and/or weft threads are tie-dyed before weaving. Chonnabot has a 1km road called Silk Road in front of the district office where numerous silk shops line the street. The Khon Kaen Silk Festival is an event held in Khon Kaen, Isan, Thailand over ten days at the end of November and the beginning of December each year. It was first held in 1980. The event is centred on promotion of the local silk industry, but includes a wide range of other activities including parades and performances.</p>

            <p>In terms of production, the Queen Sirikit Department of Sericulture estimates that in 2013, 2,87,771 kg of silk cocoons were produced by 71,630 small landholders. Another 2,552 farmers produced around 1,45,072 kg of silk. Coming to export rates, in 2006, 1,45,40,325 US dollars’ worth of silk was exported from Thailand, where silk fabrics (including Mudmee fabric) accounted for about half the silk exported. Thai silk accounts for a mere 0.1% percent of global production, with most of it being used locally. The Thai weaving industry is considered an important part of the overall economy of the country, as can be seen from its ranking as the 12th worldwide export item, with a value of about 4,300 million USD per year (Thailand Textile Institute, 2012). This number shows that the textile industry is crucial to the overall economy of the country. In addition, the textile industry is the basis of many sub-businesses, such as the suppliers of raw materials, cotton and silk, through the cloth-weaving industry. The overall industry employs approximately 1,023,000 people, which is 19% of the labour in the production part (Office of Industrial Economics, 2011).

            <p>The dyes are fiber reactive. That means a chemical reaction takes place between dye molecules and the fabric molecules. The dye bonds with the cotton and actually becomes a part of the fabric. That is why the dyes are so permanent and vibrant after several washings. And mudmee is a type of tie-dye. Cotton is made of long strands of cellulose molecules, all twisted together. Cotton is ideal for dyeing because the fibers are naturally hollow, and the dye molecules will form bonds on both the inside and outside of the fiber. If you put molecules of dye and cotton together, very little will happen until the atoms on the surfaces of the molecules are prepared for bonding. This can be done by either increasing the temperature or the pH of the fiber and dye. In the lab, we will do the latter, increasing the pH by soaking the fabric in calcium carbonate, which causes the release of a H atom from the cellulose molecule. The removal of the H atom leaves the cellulose molecule with some atoms that do not have stable octets. As a result, the dye can bond to the cellulose molecule at the site of the removed H atom. After the dye is applied, it is allowed to react in a desirable host environment for up to 24 hours. After this time, the bonding sites on the cellulose should be saturated with dye molecules. Excess dye molecules that have not bonded permanently are washed away using warm water rinse and a dye-carrying detergent. Thai ikat, or Mudmee, is traditionally dyed with natural colours that come from various sources such as plants, stones, fruits etc. The yarns are boiled once more so that the colour stays fixed. Many elements, along with their ores are used in the making of dyes for Mudmee. These include Cinnabar (mercury ore), Red Lead, Malachite (copper ore), Red Iron Oxide, Gold, and Lapis Lazuli, which is a semi- precious stone made up of three minerals- gold Pyrite, white Calcite (calcium ore), and blue Lazurite. Floor plans for few main architectural wonders of Thailand including the buildings of the Khmer Sanctuary, and the Phanom Rung Sanctuary inspired the precise geometric designs of ikat. Mudmee fabric is usually a cloth of four yards and the mudmee pattern takes up two yards of the same, but can also be woven in any desired length. There are about 150 patterns in mudmee, of which the knots are tied along 102 centimeters in width.</p>

            <p>Mudmee after all seems like another fabric right? Why should we pay any special attention to this particular piece of cloth? The truth is that, in this new world, with people moving on towards more mordern and lucrative jobs, things which are old and of cultural importance are being forgotten. The number of Mudmee workers is negligible as of now. We need to do all we can to ensure that the handiworks industry survives in today's world. The government of Thailand has understood the importance of Mudmee and they have been undertaking several steps in order to ensure that Mudmee survives. The fact that we are learning about Mudmee helps build awareness about a dying art. In order to ensure a link with our culture, we need to make sure that the importance of our cultural values and traditions is paramount. </p>
